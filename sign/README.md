On-Air Sign
==========

This is the process that runs on an IoT device, and will toggle some "On Air" or similar display on or off.
It is listening for a notification from a `client` or a `server`.

TODO:
1. build guides for RPI Zero W + `hid` USB Relay
2. Architecture - register? toggle commands? Idempotency?
3. Basic command usage
4. API spec
